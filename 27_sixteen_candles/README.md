## Description

ðŸ—¼OSINT pt3:  You find that the 'cake' from the floor below was a token for citadweller whose birthday is coming up soon.  Thereâ€™s a plaque on a wall on this floor that says @citadwellersecrets with a play button engraved on it.

## Solve

- The YouTube channel has a playlist whose description says: 

`my birthday is coming up & you are all invited! i hope you are able to view the calendar invite from my gmail for more details on it`

- The birthday is *October 7th* as seen on the X account & the Gmail account is `citadweller@gmail.com` linked & shown on the YouTube channel.
- Google Calendar events can be viewed by either using [Epieos](https://epieos.com/) OR adding the calendar of the Gmail account to your own calendar in Google Calendar under 'Subscribe to Calendar'.
- On 07/10/2025, there's a public event named 'citadweller birthday' with the flag in description.

## Flag: `citadel{c0ngr4tz_y0uv3_st4lk3d_m3_3n0ugh}`
